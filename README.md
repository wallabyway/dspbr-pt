# Enterprise PBR Sample Renderer

A WebGL2 based [glTF](https://www.khronos.org/gltf/) path-tracer which implements the [Enterprise PBR](https://github.com/DassaultSystemes-Technology/EnterprisePBRShadingModel) material model.

## Quickstart

```bash
# Installs all dependencies necessary to run and develop the renderer and viewer app  
npm install --production

# Launches the viewer in a browser with attached file watcher for auto refresh on file edits.
npm run dev

```

The renderer fully supports the glTF 2.0 metallic/roughness model. The additional Enterprise PBR material features are supported as 
additional material extensions as defined by following pull requests to the official glTF 2.0 spec.

Summary of the extensions and change proposal to the original core spec
https://github.com/KhronosGroup/glTF/pull/1738

* [Specular Extensions](https://github.com/KhronosGroup/glTF/pull/1719)
* [IoR Extension](https://github.com/KhronosGroup/glTF/pull/1718)
* [Sheen Extension](https://github.com/KhronosGroup/glTF/pull/1688)
* [Clearcoat Extension](https://github.com/KhronosGroup/glTF/pull/1756)
* [Transmission Extension](https://github.com/KhronosGroup/glTF/pull/1698) (Not yet implemeted)

**NOTE**

When disabling path-tracing, the three.js native rasterizer is used as fallback. This renderer just supports the standard glTF 2.0 material model, the extensions mentioned above will be ignored.

Please have a look at [this overview](https://k0mplex.uber.space/reports/threejs/) for comparison renderings between the two renderers for several material configurations.


## Enterprise PBR - Sample Implementation
This renderer serves as a sample implementation for Dassault Syst√®mes Enterprise PBR material model. Please have a look at 
[dspbr.glsl](./lib/shader/dspbr.glsl) for the full material implementation.


## Building

```bash
# Builds a distributable package of the viewer to ./dist
npm run build
```

## CLI Renderer

Command-line rendering is support via headless electron

To install all required extension please run install without the `--production` flag 


```bash
# Please note that this installs a full copy of electron with your node_modules (~+200MB)
npm install 

# Builds the cli renderer to ./dist
npm run build-headless 

```


```bash
# Renders an image via command-line
npm run render -- -- <scene_path> --ibl <hdr_path> --res <width> <height> --samples <num_samples>
```

For now, this writes the output image to ./output.png

## Running/Developing in Electron 

```bash
# Runs the viewer in an electron instance
npm start
```


```bash
# Runs the viewer in an electron instance with attached code watcher for development
npm run dev:electron
```

## Using the Render via Code

The renderer can be easily used as stand-alone component.
Please note that you need to have three.js setup as dependency in your scene. 

```bash
npm install three 
```

```javascript

 import { PathtracingRenderer } from './lib/renderer.js';

 let ibl = <path_to_ibl>
 let scene = <path_to_gltf>
 let renderer = new PathtracingRenderer({ "canvas": canvas });
 renderer.loadScene(scene, ibl, function () {
            renderer.render(-1, () => {
                stats.update();
            });
        });
```

Where the interface of the render function is defined as

```javascript
 function render(num_samples, frameFinishedCB, renderingFinishedCB)
```

Please have a look at src/index.html and lib/renderer.js for the details.


## Todo

### Material
- [ ] Implement proper transparency and alpha mask (cutout) handling
- [ ] Implement importance sampling for all components (clearcoat, sheen, ...)


### General
- [ ] Move path-tracing renderer to plain WebGL 


## Reference 

* This project was inspired by [Three.js glTF Viewer](https://github.com/donmccurdy/three-gltf-viewer) and the official [Khronos glTF Sample Viewer](https://github.com/KhronosGroup/glTF-Sample-Viewer).
* Env maps are rescaled versions of the [glTF Sample Viewer environment maps](https://github.com/ux3d/glTF-Sample-Environments).
